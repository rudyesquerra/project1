Project1 is a Scala console application that retrieves data using Hive. This application allows you to analize burritos quality based on more than 50 reviewers which visited 70+ tacos shops who critiqued 300+ burritos. The data set consists of a 10-dimensional system for rating them. The 10 core dimensions mentioned above are: volume, tortilla quality, temperature, meat quality, non-meat filling quality, meat:filling, uniformity, salsa quality, flavor synergy, wrap integrity.

Project was designed to quickly and efficiently run simple queries using spark sql and hive. The application consists of a menu with several choices, where the user can opt for selecting any of those, or can create a query of its own. Main tables were created beforehand, and based on these tables, queries can be run and stored in case user wants to keep track of them.
